## Description

_A game of pig dice. Currently supports two players by enabling and disabling certain buttons based on coded rules._

**Basics:**
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
  If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
  If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
  If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

Design stages:
0. Backend needs a random number generator (acquired)
1. Dice rolling function calls the previous thing (done)
2. Establish game object, rules and prototypes (probably done)
3. Switch turns on certain conditions (done)
4. Work on UI (in progress)

* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_End condition non-functional, score may occasionally do strange things_
