## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have. }_

**Basics:**
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
  If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
  If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
  If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

Design stages:
0. Backend needs a random number generator (acquired)
1. Dice rolling function calls the previous thing
2. Establish game object, rules and prototypes
3. Switch turns on certain conditions
